# FerruX Canvas
The FerruX Canvas is a tool developed while creating the FerruXengine
to abstract and ease the use of the *Pixels* buffer used by the engine.
As the tool proved useful for other possible future projects and a couple
of mutuals though that they could use it too, it was decided to extract 
it as its own library.
